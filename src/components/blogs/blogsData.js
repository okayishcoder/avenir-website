      'Can you imagine your life without Natural light and the peace it gives to your soul? Obviously, the answer is NO. \n Natural Light is one of the most precious things that nature has given us. In today\'s life, with social activities expanding, people require reliable lighting during all hours of the day and night BUT in this era of Industrialisation, and now COVID-19, it is equivalent to risking your life by going out and enjoying the beautiful natural light. Light makes us see and appreciate the beauty around us and also increases the release of serotonin, which is known as the happy hormone and further helps to have a better mood, as well as feel focused and calm. \n If the exposure to it is in perfect proportion it helps to prevent Cancer, increase your metabolism rate and enhances your physical and mental health. Now the big question which comes in our mind is how can we get perfect Natural light in our home which uplifts our mood without damaging our skin? \n Here comes, Smart Lighting Solution. In last few years, Smart Lighting Solution has become the priority of every smart home owner. It connects your lighting devices and adjusts them depending on the ambient daylight intensity. Apart from ambience there is a huge scientific logic behind Smart Lighting control system. Smart Lighting Solution is designed for both, Workplaces and Homes. \n Workplaces In a workspace, Conference Room can be a space to exchange ideas, view multimedia presentations, teleconferences etc.And if a presenter wants to incorporate a video into their meeting, he just needs to push a button labelled "A/V," which will dim the lights, close the shades and lower the projection screen. Once the video has ended pushing "Meeting" button brighten the lights and raise the shades for a better scenario to field questions. \n According to a new study conducted by Alan Hedge, a professor in the Department of Design and Environmental Analysis at Cornell, workers in day lit office environments reported an 84 percent drop in symptoms of eyestrain, headaches and blurred vision symptoms, which can detract from productivity. And another survey from Future Workplace shows that over 1,600 employees ranked “access to natural light and views of the outdoors" as their number one desire for a workplace environment. /n Residences In our homes, Smart Lighting Solution can regulate the natural light which comes from outside to your room. When you wake up in the morning you are suddenly exposed to very high quantity of light by manually switching to your light bulbs which inhibits your Brain\'s natural process of working. On other hand, when you have Smart Lighting solution you just press "Good Morning" button and your curtains will drag allowing the low intensity natural light to come into your room and make you feel the freshness of nature just sitting in your home and when the optimum sunlight meets a minimum desired level, lights are turned off. Once it gets dark outside, lights are turned back on. So, switching will usually occur only twice a day - at the beginning and at the end of it. \n According to Brenda Mc Mahon, MD of the Neurobiology Research Unit at the Copenhagen University Hospital, Denmark, "If people are exposed to light in the morning that mimics the wavelengths of daylight, they become better at coping with anxiety-provoking experiences. The light simply improves the communication between the regions of the brain that are central to our handling of emotions such as stress and anxiety". Combining Natural daylight and artificial light provides a constant, optimised lighting environment which improves wellbeing of occupants. You can enjoy the warmth of natural light, while not having to deal with unnecessary light pollution generated by luminaires. \n So, Make Sunlight your spotlight with a sophisticated daylight control system and take full advantage of beautiful natural light along with other sources by putting flexibility at your fingertips! No wires, no batteries, no limits!The end result is excellent energy savings potential that cuts your energy bills and adds an unexpected boost to your mental and physical health. Has it ever been easier than today on such a large scale? We think not!',

      "'It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent one, but the one most responsive to change.' \n As the humankind is facing its biggest existential crisis since World War II, COVID 19 has disrupted the way people live all around the world. Few weeks ago, no one in their wildest dream would have thought about a global lockdown which would force more than half of global population to stay home. This was unpredicted, appalling, distressing and will have a long lasting effect on people, society, businesses, and the global economy at large scale. But every cloud has a silver lining and COVID 19 was a blessing for all of us to strengthen our faith and belief in the power of technology. \n The need of the hour for all companies is to go for new business technologies during this crisis. Organizations should create new business models that will impact all components of performance. Use of technologies like Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning have become the lifeline for a large set of companies worldwide to ensure business continuity and offering uninterrupted services to their customers. \n In spite of global recession, there are some companies that have adapted well to the situation and doing better than before. These businesses are taking a second look at how they are positioning themselves in the market and how their current operations can be improved ensuring the safety of their employees and customers. For example, Pizza chains like Dominos and Papa John's have adopted no contact delivery method. They are accepting online orders only. Papa John is offering a touchless experience for pizza delivery and their 'Papa Truck' is fully functioning for customers who want better insight into their orders. They haven't slowed down their operations, but instead kept pushing forward and investing in their people and technology. They are also offering custom drop-off points. Customers can indicate where exactly they would prefer their order to be left by a delivery person — it can be left by the front door, on a bench, at a reception desk, or whatever is easiest and more comfortable. Apart from these two, food companies like First Choice, Boka, Eden East and J.W Lopes were quick in adapting these measures to run their business smoothly amid lockdown. \n COVID 19 lockdown came as a blessing in disguise for OTT platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime. With everyone stuck at home and theaters shut down for a long time, everyone prefers watching their favorite movies and web series on these platforms. Film makers are releasing their movies directly on these platforms instead of waiting for theaters to re-open. In this way, film makers are also not suffering losses due to delay in their film's release. \n Although Covid-19 has significantly impacted the beauty industry, makeup continues to play an important role in many people's lives as part of their desire to look and feel their best. MAC Cosmetics has been working with YouCam to roll out AR smart mirrors in its stores since the end of 2017, and only 2.6% of stores are currently equipped. It introduced an AR try-on tool through a dedicated website tab in August 2019. MAC's AR try-on tool comes at a time when shopping habits and the retail environment continues to change post-coronavirus shutdowns. The company is hoping its AR-play will be used as an Omni-channel tool moving forward. \n Technology is playing its role in helping almost every business in surviving this recession. Many businesses have started accepting orders online or over the phone. Companies like Amazon and Flipkart have started delivering products with the help of drones to avoid human contact. Even small businesses have started accepting online payments to avoid cash transaction. Educational institutes have started giving online classes to students via applications like Zoom. The graph given below indicates the increase in online customers across different sectors during lockdown. \n As people stay at home, consumers have shifted from personal interactions, where they provide direct feedback, to digital interactions. As it's no longer possible to eat out, they'll be ordering online deliveries. Going to shops to buy clothes might be risky, so they would prefer shopping online. The same pattern is being replicated in sectors across the globe. That's where AI comes into picture and helps us to find out what customers feel and need. \n Not only in understanding consumer behavior, this technology can also help businesses post COVID 19 to manage their demand and supply. For example, a big steel company has information about the various factors that might influence demand for steel, such as the demand for automobiles. This data can be used to match up to what their supply chains can produce. In this way the company is not producing more than needed and not leaving unfulfilled demand too. Now, more than ever, it's important for companies to understand the environment we're living in and adapt to it. These are the companies that will not only survive during the pandemic but get ahead of their competition.",
